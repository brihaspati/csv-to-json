**Very simple repo to convert a csv file to json using csvjson-csv2json**

## How To?

- Put the csv file that you want to convert into `/Source` directory
- Open `index.js` and on `line 3` update the file name(filename could have been pushed from the shell, but chose the simplest solution)
- Open the terminal and run `npm run start`
- If the conversion is successful, converted json file will be in `./output` directory
